# ForageSnap
Contains our Applied Machine Learning Intensive final project development.

## Our goals are to:
1. Have a complete mobile application to be published on both App stores.
2. Snap pictures of plants/foliage and determine if they are edible or not.

## TO-DO
### Data
- [x] Find data
- [x] Grab data URLs
- [x] Create ML folder structure (train, test, val) 
- [ ] Download half of images directly into google drive (to be used with colab)
- [ ] Download all data into drive

### Base ML Model
- [x] Create model using MobileNetV2 with simple classifiers for testing
- [x] Create model with FastAI (ResNet50+) using more data/classes
- [x] Create mobile ready model with 5+ classes
- [ ] Create mobile model with 20+ classes
- [ ] Create mobile model with all desired classes
- [ ] Create webapp ready mdoel with all desired classes

### Mobile Application
- [x] Go through TFLite tutorial and get working base image classification app
- [x] Modify app - Loading Screen
- [x] Modify app - Banner
- [x] Modify app - "drag up" information
- [x] Modify app - Simple ForageSnap Model
- [ ] Modify app - More complex ForageSnap Model (30 - 50% of data)
- [ ] Modify app - Final ForageSnap model (90%+ of Data)
- [ ] Make mobile app more aesthetic

### Web Application
- [x] Create base Flask App + Server
- [x] Get upload image button working
- [ ] Use pretrained model to predict
- [ ] Upload ForageSnap webapp ready model
- [ ] Make web app more aesthetic
